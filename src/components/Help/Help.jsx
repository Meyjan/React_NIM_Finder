            Enter your desired username and password at the provided input box.
            After that, click the register button It may have been taken by
            others though, but usually it haven't been taken by others, so
            usually you won't have to rethink for your username and password.
            After being registered, you can access your log into your account so
            that you can start <i>stalking</i>.

            <b>LOGIN</b>

          <p>
            Log into your account that you have been registered. You can input
            your username and your password at the provided space and hit the
            login button. After logging in, you now gain access to the API and
            now can start <i>stalking</i>. Remember to register first if you
            don't have an account. Otherwise, you won't be able to login (
            <i>obviously</i>).

            Your stalking machine! Be it your friend's NIM or name, this machine
            can look up the details for you! Just enter your query at the
            provided space and click on the search button to start searching.
            This machine will then return the result it gets from the API, which
            is the list of name and the details about that person which has the
            same criteria as your query (or nothing if it doesn't match with
            anything). Do remember, this feature is only accessible once you've
            logged in.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>LOGOUT</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            Log out from your account. This feature is only accessible once
            you've logged in. Though I should say you shouldn't use this feature
            because it's preventing you from stalking your friends. I suggest
            you should only use this feature once doctors and psychiatrists come
            into your house because you've done too much stalking.
